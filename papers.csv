The equivalent constitutive relation of the coupled MC emulators is theoretically presented in details. The coupled MCs are then utilized to structure new relaxation oscillators (ROs) with the purpose of achieving controllable oscillation frequency and duty cycle. In consideration of different parameter configuration cases, an experimental investigation is carried out using a practical circuit emulating the dual coupled MCs and the ROs. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical results confirms that dual coupled MCs can be utilized to structure ROs with controllability.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Ii-express Briefs

Although both software and hardware virtualization technologies has been proposed for dynamic reconfiguration, each one is currently designed to be executed independently and thus their cooperative operations that dynamically reconfigure both of them have not been well-considered. We have developed a method for multilayer in-service reconfiguration that comprises Ethernet-based distributed device reconfiguration (hardware layer), fine-granular I/O service continuity management (software layer), and their orchestration. Application to the management of a session initiation protocol server system built on distributed resources demonstrated that this method achieves dynamic load balancing in response to call rate increases without any failed calls.",2007,network computing and applications

Nowadays, the modeling of driver behavior is a frequently suggested research topic and a lot of different models exist. Here, the steering control models, available in literature are presented and discussed. The similarities in different models are shown and a generalized model is proposed, merging the major different models into the same mathematical structure. Finally, the correspondence of a model is validated using real drivers data collected on a driving simulator.",2016,

This becomes quite challenging, as more wind power is included into the power system. This paper proposes a coordinated distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for the LFC of a power system that includes inherently variable wind-power generations. This DMPC communicates power system measurement and prediction data, and considers the information of other controllers for their local objective to realize effective coordination. The controllers solve the optimization problem while considering given constraints, e.g., generation rate constraints, wind speed, pitch angle, and load input constraints for each area. Since the wind-power output depends largely on the wind speed, different optimization modes for the DMPC were used. Both simulation and experimental tests of a four-area interconnected power system LFC, which consists of thermal plants, hydro units, and a wind farm, demonstrate the improved efficiency of the coordinated DMPC.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics

Using a Fresnel lens and a wideband vibrotactile device, we changed the magnification of 3D images while keeping tactile feedback signals constant in collision events. The tested events were collisions between a rigid object in a subject's hand and three types of balls hung as pendulums. The results showed that there is an acceptable range for each event and the ranges were comparable throughout the experi- ments. The results presented here provide the basic knowledge for practical 3D tactile visual displays in mid-air.",2016,
cc491405-dcde-4974-99a2-9474698513ac,Efficient Parity Update for Scaling RAID-like Storage Systems,"It is inevitable to scale RAID systems with the increasing demand of storage capacity and I/O throughput. When scaling RAID systems, we will always need to update parity to maintain the reliability of the storage systems. There are two schemes, read-modify-write (RMW) and read-reconstruct-write (RCW), to update parity. However most existing scaling approaches simply use RMW to update parity. While in many scenarios for existing scaling approaches, RCW performs better in terms of the number of scaling I/Os. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called EPU, to analyze which of RCW and RMW is better for a scaling scenario and select the more efficient one to save the scaling I/Os. We apply EPU to online scaling scenarios and further use two optimizations, I/O overlap and access aggregation, to enhance the online scaling performance. Using Scale-CRS, one of the existing scaling approaches, as an example, we show via numerical studies that Scale-CRS+EPU reduces the amount of scaling I/Os over the traditional Scale-CRS in many scaling cases. To justify the online efficiency of EPU, we implement both Scale-CRS+EPU and Scale-CRS in a simulator with Disksim as a working module. Through extensive experiments, we show that Scale-CRS+EPU reduces the scaling time and the online response time of user requests over Scale-CRS.",2016,international conference on networking

However, the attenuation or deterioration of signals, arises from physical phenomena in transmission lines, restricts the maximum frequency at which the signal can transmit. This paper investigates data recovery techniques especially for multiple-valued data transmission in order to achieve high-speed data transmission in VLSI systems. We discuss various types of equalization techniques including inductive-coupling wireless communication to compensate for the frequency-dependent loss of wiring, resulting in improving a data transfer rate.",2007,international symposium on multiple valued logic
c62feade-aa42-4caf-8a6b-8cfb81b761dd,Interpreting maps of science using citation context sentiments: a preliminary investigation,"It is proposed that citation contexts, the text surrounding references in scientific papers, be analyzed in terms of an expanded notion of sentiment, defined to include attitudes and dispositions toward the cited work. Maps of science at both the specialty and global levels are used as the basis of this analysis. Citation context samples are taken at these levels and contrasted for the appearance of cue word sets, analyzed with the aid of methods from corpus linguistics. Sentiments are shown to vary within a specialty and can be understood in terms of cognitive and social factors. Within-specialty and between-specialty co-citations are contrasted and in some cases suggest a correlation of sentiment with structural location. For example, the sentiment of ""uncertainty"" is important in interdisciplinary co-citation links, while ""utility"" is more prevalent within the specialty. Suggestions are made for linking sentiments to technical terms, and for developing sentiment ""baselines"" for all of science.",2011,Scientometrics
089083c7-0967-4fef-a935-1f378d815d06,Maximizing diversity in biology and beyond,"Entropy, under a variety of names, has long been used as a measure of diversity in ecology, as well as in genetics, economics and other fields. There is a spectrum of viewpoints on diversity, indexed by a real parameter q giving greater or lesser importance to rare species. Leinster and Cobbold (2012) proposed a one-parameter family of diversity measures taking into account both this variation and the varying similarities between species. Because of this latter feature, diversity is not maximized by the uniform distribution on species. So it is natural to ask: which distributions maximize diversity, and what is its maximum value? In principle, both answers depend on q, but our main theorem is that neither does. Thus, there is a single distribution that maximizes diversity from all viewpoints simultaneously, and any list of species has an unambiguous maximum diversity value. Furthermore, the maximizing distribution(s) can be computed in finite time, and any distribution maximizing diversity from some particular viewpoint q g 0 actually maximizes diversity for all q. Although we phrase our results in ecological terms, they apply very widely, with applications in graph theory and metric geometry.",2016,Entropy

In addition, these large-scale feature models typically involve several stakeholders from different domains during development and maintenance. We aim at supporting such stakeholders by deriving and explaining implicit constraints for partial feature models. A partial feature model can either be a submodel of a feature model representing the full product line or a specific feature model in a set of interrelated models. For every implicit constraint, we generate an explanation exposing which other model parts and constraints interfere with the partial model of interest. Thus, stakeholders are only confronted with a small part of the feature model reducing the complexity while preserving the necessary information about dependencies. Our approach is implemented in the open-source framework FeatureIDE.",2016,

It is shown that the same structural conditions on the set of feasible evaluations that lead to dictatorship in the model without abstentions, lead to oligarchy in the presence of abstentions. Arrow's impossibility theorem for social welfare functions, Gibbard's oligarchy theorem for quasi-transitive social decision functions, as well as some apparently new theorems on preference aggregation, are obtained as corollaries.",2010,Journal of Economic Theory

In this paper we define the logic Ł• whose Lindenbaum algebra is an MV-algebra (object of ), and establish a link between Ł• and the infinite valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł. We define U-operators, that have properties of universal quantifiers, and establish a bijection that maps an MV-algebra endowed with a U-operator (cf. [20-22]) into an MV•-algebra endowed with a U-operator. This map extends to a functor that is a categorical equivalence.",2014,Mathematical Logic Quarterly

a634125a-79de-437a-a812-9cc5611fceaf,A Novel Axial Flux Permanent-Magnet Machine for Flywheel Energy Storage System: Design and Analysis,"This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel axial flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machine for a flywheel energy storage system (FESS). Its design and control facilitate significant reduction in axial bearing stress and losses. Due to the unconventional flux distribution in this machine, a 3-D finite element method was employed for its design and analysis, including its electromagnetic torque and axial force performances. The effects of the rotor PM skew angle on the cogging torque and the axial force have been studied. It is found that an optimum skew angle is effective in reducing the overall cogging torque with negligible effect on the static axial force. The latter is crucial as it can be utilized to minimize the axial bearing stress in FESS application. The concept, design, and analysis methodology have been validated by experimental results from an experimental AFPM machine prototype.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics
fa2bb10e-7ba4-4fdb-ad47-8ca70c8299c9,Optimal Feature Subset Selection for Neuron Spike Sorting Using the Genetic Algorithm,"It is crucial for a neuron spike sorting algorithm to cluster data from different neurons efficiently. In this study, the search capability of the Genetic Algorithm GA is exploited for identifying the optimal feature subset for neuron spike sorting with a clustering algorithm. Two important objectives of the optimization process are considered: to reduce the number of features and increase the clustering performance. Specifically, we employ a binary GA with the silhouette evaluation criterion as the fitness function for neuron spike sorting using the Super-Paramagnetic Clustering SPC algorithm. The clustering results of SPC with and without the GA-based feature selector are evaluated using benchmark synthetic neuron spike data sets. The outcome indicates the usefulness of the GA in identifying a smaller feature set with improved clustering performance.",2015,international conference on neural information processing
b47b23a5-cb00-4fc1-93f7-4a230b6754b2,"Breakout Local Search for the Steiner Tree Problem with Revenue, Budget and Hop Constraints","The Steiner tree problem (STP) is one of the most popular combinatorial optimization problems with various practical applications. In this paper, we propose a Breakout Local Search (BLS) algorithm for an important generalization of the STP: the Steiner tree problem with revenue, budget and hop constraints (STPRBH), which consists of determining a subtree of a given undirected graph which maximizes the collected revenues, subject to both budget and hop constraints. Starting from a probabilistically constructed initial solution, BLS uses a Neighborhood Search (NS) procedure based on several specifically designed move operators for local optimization, and employs an adaptive diversification strategy to escape from local optima. The diversification mechanism is implemented by adaptive perturbations, guided by dedicated information of discovered high-quality solutions. Computational results based on 240 benchmarks show that BLS produces competitive results with respect to several previous approaches. For the 56 most challenging instances with unknown optimal results, BLS succeeds in improving 49 and matching one best known results within reasonable time. For the 184 instances which have been solved to optimality, BLS can also match 167 optimal results.",2014,European Journal of Operational Research
628114df-b256-4905-9a31-9e8e0420c398,Robust Eye Detection under Active Infrared Illumination,"Eye detection is very important for automatic face recognition and gaze tracking. In this paper we propose an algorithm for eye detection under active infrared (IR) illumination. A simple hardware enables us to make use of a physiological property of the eyes. A new thresholding method is introduced in order to effectively search the regions of interest (ROI). An appearance model is then used to verify the pupil candidates. However, the existence of eyeglasses has a negative effect on selection of candidates. Regarding this the generalized symmetry transform (GST) is exploited. By using a simplified distance weight, we reduce the computational cost of the original transform. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed eye detection method.",2006,international conference on pattern recognition

The developed phased array antenna comprises four log-periodic antennas, a phase shifter, and a Wilkinson power divider. This antenna was fabricated using the standard microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) process including an air bridge for unipolar circuit implementations on the same GaAs substrate. The total chip size of the fabricated phased array antenna is 4.8 mm × 4.5 mm. Measurement results showed that the fabricated phased array antenna had a very wide band performance from 80 GHz to 110 GHz with return loss characteristics better than -10 dB. In the center frequency of 94 GHz, the fabricated phased array antenna showed a return loss of -16 dB and a gain of 4.43 dBi. The developed antenna is expected to be widely applied in many applications at W-band frequency.",2015,
